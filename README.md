# Newton-method-and-fractals

Newton's method of finding the roots of a polynomial hides an interesting mathematical structure underneath. After applying Newton's algorithm, each point at the complex plane is "attracted" to one of the roots. 
The fractal structure emerges if we colour each initial point with the colour corresponding to one of the roots to which this point is attracted. Therefore these attracting regions in the complex plane exhibit infinite complexity and strong sensitivity to the choice of the initial point close to the boundery areas. Boundary areas are regions where two or more colours meet on the plot. This property is well known for the nonlinear physical systems which exhibit chaotic behaviour. Here I present how to solve and visualize this problem in Mathematica.
